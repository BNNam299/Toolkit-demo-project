Knowledge here is a lens for thinking, not a procedure. Where a project's own standard or template screen says otherwise, the project wins.
The measured designer structure (paddings, gaps, toolbar and CTA heights) lives in `screen-structure.md`.

## 1. Container-first thinking

Do not design for a list of phone models. Design for the **real space of the window/container**, because:

- Split screen, multi-window, Stage Manager and desktop mode change the available area.
- Foldables change posture and the hinge/fold area.
- Orientation does not always predict width.
- Dynamic Type / font scale changes the size of the content.

## 2. iOS layout

- Respect the **safe area**, status bar, home indicator, camera cutout and keyboard.
- Use flexible Auto Layout / SwiftUI layout; avoid fixed coordinates.
- Use size classes and container size to change the structure when needed.
- Let content scroll when text is large; never clip text or lock a cell's height.
- Put frequent actions where they are easy to reach — especially the middle and bottom of the screen for one-handed use.
- Keep important content away from screen edges and system gesture areas.
- When switching portrait/landscape or resizing, keep selection, scroll position and task context.

## 3. Material 3 breakpoints

Material now calls "window size classes" **breakpoints**:

| Breakpoint | Window width | Typical example |
|---|---:|---|
| Compact | `< 600dp` | Phone in portrait |
| Medium | `600–839dp` | Tablet in portrait, foldable open in portrait |
| Expanded | `840–1199dp` | Phone in landscape, tablet in landscape, small desktop |
| Large | `1200–1599dp` | Desktop |
| Extra-large | `≥ 1600dp` | Desktop / ultra-wide monitor |

A breakpoint describes the **window**, not the device. The same device can change breakpoint when rotated, resized or run in multi-window.
Detail: `../material-design-3/SKILL.md` (foundations__ layout pages).

## 4. Five questions when the breakpoint changes

1. **Reveal** — is there content or an action that should become visible instead of sitting in a menu?
2. **Divide** — should one pane become two or three?
3. **Resize** — how should cards, images, lists or type change size?
4. **Reposition** — should navigation, actions and content move to suit ergonomics?
5. **Swap** — should a functionally equivalent component replace another, e.g. navigation bar → navigation rail?

Do not swap just because there is room. The two components must be functionally equivalent and the change must improve operation or structure.

## 5. Material canonical layouts

| Layout | Use |
|---|---|
| **Feed** | Grid/cards whose column count can change; for large amounts of browsable content |
| **List-detail** | A list plus its detail; compact is usually one pane, expanded usually two panes |
| **Supporting pane** | The main area takes most of the space, a secondary pane supports it; suits editor–preview, content–comments, map–detail |

## 6. Spacing

- Material uses an **8dp** scale, with token `space100 = 8dp`; extend it when the system needs.
- Distinguish **padding** (inside), **gap** (between elements) and **margin** (outside).
- Prefer padding/gap on the container over margins scattered on each child.
- iOS does not mandate a single arithmetic grid; use system spacing and the product's semantic tokens.
- Use `leading/trailing` instead of `left/right` to support RTL.
- For long reading passages limit line length; Material suggests about **40–60 characters per line** in expanded layouts.

## 7. Foldables and interruption zones

- Never put a CTA, drag handle or important content on the hinge/fold.
- Treat the fold as a spacer or a natural boundary between panes.
- Do not assume "expanded = scale everything up"; prefer a multi-pane structure.
- Test continuity when folding/unfolding: video, forms, selection and progress must be preserved.

## 8. Corner radius rules

From the designer's personal UI notes; numbers are exact.

| Rule | Statement | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Same frame, same radius** | Containers inside the same frame have **equal** corner radii | — |
| **Adjacent radius** | A **large** element's radius = **½ the height of the small element next to it** | an image with radius 22 next to a 44-high button · an info bar 50 high → the container below it has radius 25 |
| **Equivalent form** | A chip-like bar has **height = 2 × the radius** of the other large frames | chip row 44 high ↔ cards with radius 22 |

The measured radius scale of the designer's files (pill / 21 / 28 / 36 / 44) is in `screen-structure.md` §8.

## 9. Action hierarchy and feature exposure

- **Primary action = big button; secondary actions = small buttons or partly hidden.**
- **Advanced features that mainstream users are not familiar with → put the function directly on the surface**, so that one tap starts the work (do not hide it behind a menu or explanation step).

Two-button arrangements (side by side vs stacked) are in `screen-structure.md` §7b.

## 10. Layer opacity vs alpha fill

| | Affects |
|---|---|
| **Layer opacity** | The **whole object** — fill + stroke + effects |
| **Alpha in the fill colour** | Only the **fill colour** |

- **Do not use layer opacity to "save colours".** Create a colour token with its own alpha and name it clearly (`Primary / Black 50%`). Reasons:
  - code performance — rendering an alpha fill is lighter than computing opacity for a whole layer;
  - consistency — the token is fixed; with layer opacity the developer has to guess whether it is 50% or 48%;
  - maintenance — change one variable and you are done;
  - interaction — hover states stacking opacity on opacity are hard to control.
- **Use layer opacity only to fade a whole composite** (a card made of image + text + icon) to express **Disabled**.

## 11. Color dust

**Avoid colour dust** — a tint mixed into white/black areas produces a cloudy, dirty colour that loses its saturation. Keep tinted overlays and
tinted neutrals deliberate; when a surface needs a hint of brand, use a defined token rather than a low-alpha brand wash over grey.

## 12. Letter spacing

**Letter spacing = font size × 2.5%** (designer's rule; e.g. 16 pt → 0.4 pt).

> Difference from the tool demo: `../figma-ui-flow/references/design-system.md` §2.3 suggests slightly negative tracking for large sizes and slightly
> positive for small all-caps text. When working in a file by this designer, use the 2.5% rule; otherwise the file's own text styles win.

## 13. Adaptive layout for iOS 27 and iPhone Duo — where to look

Full knowledge lives in the `iphone-duo-adaptive` skill (`../iphone-duo-adaptive/SKILL.md`) and Apple's page
`../apple-hig/references/designing-for-iphone-duo.md`. Topics to look up there:

- size class is a layout signal, not a device identifier
- asymmetric safe areas; full bleed vs safe content
- displacement: continuous vs point content, related groups
- choosing the container: navigation split view · split arrangement · overlay arrangement
- even column counts around the fold
- intermediate resize states, readable width
- concentric corner radii close to the hardware
- ergonomics and occluded areas per posture
- loading / empty / error inside an adaptive container
- the adaptive-layout deep dive: state vector, four geometry layers, six transformations, the reserved-region algorithm, the container decision tree, patterns by content type
- the community starter kit: 6 states, the `Duo System` variables, layout guides, 9 product patterns, 10 Do / Don't pairs — **for mockups only**

Measured geometry worth remembering: **vertical bar 84, toolbar 84, margin 20, sheet margin 16**. The designer's own Duo packaging (four variants per
screen, pane split, `Pane controls`) is in `screen-structure.md` §11.
