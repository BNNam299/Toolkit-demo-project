description: Tool-agnostic, "master"-level workflow and knowledge for building UI in Figma — 11 core rules, an 8-stage process with approval gates (brief → foundations/tokens → components → explore 2–3 directions → build screens → prototype → QA → handoff), and a mandatory OUTSIDE-IN screen build loop in three passes (layout with sized placeholders → fill with components and content → lock with audit/stress), numeric checks after every write and one screenshot per pass, three modes (Sketch / From template / New build), one screen finished before starting another. Use when the user wants to design/draw/build screens or UI flows, create a design system or component library, explore creative directions, clean up or standardize a file, review/QA, prepare a developer handoff, or assess Figma skill level — even when they only say "draw this screen for me", "design a paywall", "create an app UI", "this Figma file is a mess", including Vietnamese requests such as "vẽ giúp tôi màn hình này", "thiết kế paywall", "tạo UI app", "file Figma lộn xộn quá". Concrete tool operations live in the figma-agent-tools skill.

# figma-ui-flow — Workflow and knowledge for building UI in Figma

This skill answers **what to do, in what order, to what standard**. **Which tool to use** lives in the `figma-agent-tools` skill (the handbook for every figma-agent MCP tool). One standard, two executors:

- **Agent mode** — a Figma write tool is available (`figma-agent` or the remote Figma MCP): the agent reads and writes the canvas itself according to this standard.
- **Designer mode** — no MCP, or the user wants to do it themselves: the agent outputs **step-by-step instructions**, checklists, and token/naming tables for the person to follow.

Let `SKILL_DIR` be the directory containing this file.

## Document map — read the right file at the right time

| When you need | Read |
|---|---|
| **Building any screen** — the three-pass outside-in loop, modes, check budget, Definition of Done | `references/build-loop.md` |
| Session has `figma-agent` tools (`figma_status`, `render_tree`…): stage/pass → tool | `references/run-with-figma-agent.md` + the `figma-agent-tools` skill |
| Session only has the official Figma MCP (`use_figma`…) | `references/remote-figma-mcp.md` |
| Page structure, layer/frame naming, Auto Layout, grids | `references/file-standards.md` |
| Variables, tokens, styles, components, variants, libraries | `references/design-system.md` |
| Moodboards, direction exploration, critique, Motion, shaders, AI | `references/creative-process.md` |
| QA, accessibility, Dev Mode, developer handoff (iOS/Android/Web) | `references/handoff-qa.md` |
| Skill assessment, learning path, shortcuts | `references/skill-ladder.md` |
| Check a token JSON file (names, aliases, contrast) | `scripts/check_tokens.py` |
| Brief template / QA report template | `assets/brief.template.md`, `assets/qa-report.template.md` |
| Two-level token JSON template with Light/Dark | `assets/tokens.example.json` |

Do not read everything at once. Each stage below states which file it needs.

**Platform knowledge in other skills** — load it when the screen belongs to that platform; do not copy it here:

| Need | Skill |
|---|---|
| Touch targets, states, feedback, sheet/dialog/snackbar, thumb zone, gestures | `mobile-ux-fundamentals` |
| Layout, information density, avoiding card stacks/meaningless emptiness, visual review | `mobile-ui-master` |
| iPhone / iPad / Watch / Widget per HIG | `apple-design-iphone`, `apple-design-ipad`, `apple-design-watch`, `apple-design-widget` |
| Prompts for illustrations, hero images, backgrounds | `generating-oneshot-image-prompts` |

## 11 core rules (they override any personal habit)

1. **No raw values.** Color, font size, spacing, radius, and shadow are always bound to a variable or style. A hand-typed hex code in a layer is a defect. **One exception — Stage 4 directions before the brand is chosen:** brand and accent colors are free hex (you may add accent colors to explore); neutrals/greyscale and semantic colors (success, warning, error, info) still come from the system. Once a direction is chosen, promote its brand/accent colors into variables and bind everything (`references/creative-process.md` §4.4).
2. **Auto Layout by default.** Every frame that holds content uses Auto Layout; free positioning is only for decoration, background images, and overlays — and those are clearly named `decor/…`.
3. **Search before you create.** Before drawing an element, search the library (agent: `search_design_system`). Create something new only when you are sure it does not exist.
4. **Meaningful names, no default names.** No `Frame 12`, `Rectangle 4`, `Group 7` in anything handed off.
5. **Semantics first, values second.** Tokens are named by role (`color/text/primary`), not by value (`blue-500`) — except at the primitive level.
6. **Explore wide before going deep.** Every creative problem gets at least 2–3 genuinely different directions before one is polished.
7. **Every state is drawn.** Default, pressed, disabled, loading, empty, error, long content, large text, dark mode.
8. **Keep draft and approved areas separate.** Explore on the `🧪 Explore` page; only approved work goes into `✅ Ready`.
9. **Non-destructive.** The agent does not delete or overwrite the user's work; edit on a copy or branch, and confirm before changing anything out of scope.
10. **Check numbers every write, eyes every pass.** After every write, read back sizes (`get_node`): fixed sizes kept, children fit, FILL/HUG as planned. At the end of each pass, screenshot the screen and compare it with the intent; screenshot an individual block only when it is visually unusual. Never report "done" without looking.
11. **One screen at a time, outside-in, in three passes.** Pass 1 Layout (frame + regions + sized placeholder blocks, locked while empty) → Pass 2 Fill (components first, then content by cluster) → Pass 3 Lock (audit + stress → DoD). Pick the mode first: Sketch, From template, or New build. Start the next screen only once the current one meets the Definition of Done. Details: `references/build-loop.md`.

## The 8-stage process

Not every task runs all 8. Determine the entry point in Stage 0, then run from there. There is a **human approval gate** after Stages 1, 4, and 7.

### Stage 0 — Intake and orientation

1. Determine the mode: does the session have a Figma write tool — the remote Figma MCP (`use_figma`, `get_metadata`…) **or** `figma-agent` (`figma_status`, `render_tree`, `search_design_system`…)? Yes → Agent. With `figma-agent`: load the `figma-agent-tools` skill, read `references/run-with-figma-agent.md` to know the tool for each step, call `figma_status`, and resolve any `versionCheck` warning before starting. No tool → Designer (same process, the output is instructions). If the user wants Agent mode but the tools are missing: say clearly that they need to open the figma-agent-UI plugin (or connect the remote Figma MCP), then continue in Designer mode.
2. Classify the request and choose the entry point:

| Request | Start at |
|---|---|
| New project from scratch | Stage 1 |
| "Clean up / standardize this file" | Stage 7 (audit) → back to Stages 2–3 to fix |
| Create a design system / library | Stage 2 → 3 |
| Draw a new screen in a file that already has a system | Stage 5 |
| "Find ideas / make it prettier / more creative" | Stage 4 |
| Prototype, animation | Stage 6 |
| Developer handoff | Stage 7 → 8 |
| Skill assessment / learning Figma | `references/skill-ladder.md` |

3. Agent: read the file structure first (pages, top-level frames, existing design system) to know what the file contains. Do not guess.

### Stage 1 — Brief and file foundation → *gate*

Read `references/file-standards.md` and `assets/brief.template.md`.

1. Lock a minimal brief: product, users, platform (iOS / Android / Web / cross-platform), business goal, constraints (existing brand, deadline, accessibility), success criteria. Ask about anything missing — at most 3–4 questions, batched in one message.
2. Set up the file skeleton using the standard pages (Cover, Brief, Explore, Foundations, Components, Screens, Prototype, Ready, Archive).
3. **Gate:** present a one-page brief + the file skeleton. Wait for the user's confirmation before continuing.

### Stage 2 — Foundations

Read `references/design-system.md` sections 1–4.

1. Variables in 3 levels: **Primitives** (raw palette, number scales) → **Semantic** (roles, with Light/Dark… modes) → **Component** (only when truly needed).
2. Typography scale, spacing scale (4/8 grid), radius, elevation, motion tokens.
3. Set `scopes` on each variable so it only appears where it applies.
4. If tokens exist as JSON: run `python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/check_tokens.py <file.json>` and fix every error before continuing.
5. Build a Foundations page that visualizes every token (swatches, type specimen, spacing ruler).

### Stage 3 — Components

Read `references/design-system.md` sections 5–8.

1. Build order: atoms (icon, text, divider) → basic elements (button, input, chip, avatar) → composites (card, list row, nav bar, tab bar, sheet).
2. Each component: clear anatomy, correct Auto Layout, 100% token binding, component properties instead of redundant variants, all states, a description and documentation link.
3. Name variants as `Property=Value`. Name properties consistently across the whole library.
4. Build a "Playground" page to test each component: stretch it, long text, switch modes, change sizes.

### Stage 4 — Creative exploration → *gate*

Read `references/creative-process.md`.

1. Gather references and build a moodboard annotated with "what to take from this".
2. Diverge: create **2–3 genuinely different directions** (different in concept, not just color), each applied to the same 1–2 "key" screens. Brand/accent colors are free hex here; neutrals and semantic colors come from the system (`references/creative-process.md` §4.4).
3. Each direction comes with: a name, a one-sentence idea, strengths, risks, who it suits.
4. **Gate:** stop for the user to choose or mix. This is the most expensive decision to get wrong — do not choose on their behalf.
5. Converge: turn the chosen direction into rules — promote its brand/accent hex into Primitive + Semantic variables, bind every layer, update components — and only then polish.

### Stage 5 — Build screens (the outside-in loop)

Read `references/build-loop.md` — **mandatory** for every screen.

1. **Pick the mode:** **Sketch** (quick idea, Stage 4), **From template** (a similar screen exists: clone and edit what differs), **New build** (complex, no template). First screen of a set = New build, the rest = From template.
2. **Pass 0 Prepare:** screen goal, one primary CTA, real content, a region map down to block sizes, which blocks repeat (→ components), images generated up front.
3. **Pass 1 Layout (1–2 writes):** root frame at the platform size (`file-standards.md` section 4) + named regions + **sized placeholder blocks** carrying their final Auto Layout. Numeric check, then one screenshot: the screen should already read as the final layout in grey boxes.
4. **Pass 2 Fill:** components first for anything repeated ≥ 3 times (Stage 3), then fill placeholders **by cluster** (several blocks per write) and add real text, icons, images in batches. Numeric check after each write; one screenshot at the end of the pass, extra ones only for unusual blocks.
5. **Pass 3 Lock:** audit + stress + one final screenshot, fix until it meets the **Definition of Done** (skipped in Sketch).
6. Screen meets DoD → report in one line → only then move to the next screen, in From-template mode. State variants (empty, loading, error, long text, large text, dark) are From-template screens of the one that met DoD.
7. Arrange left → right by flow, group with Sections, name them `Flow / Screen / State`.

### Stage 6 — Prototype and motion

Read `references/creative-process.md` sections 7–8.

1. Prototype the main flow first, secondary branches later. Use interactive components for micro-interactions (toggle, tab, accordion) so you don't have to wire every screen.
2. Use variables + conditional logic when the prototype needs state (cart, login, counter).
3. Motion (Smart Animate / Figma Motion): every animation has a reason — guidance, feedback, or spatial continuity. Duration and easing come from motion tokens. Always provide a Reduce Motion alternative.

### Stage 7 — QA → *gate*

Read `references/handoff-qa.md` sections 1–3, use `assets/qa-report.template.md`.

1. Run the 6-group QA checklist: structure, tokens, layout, states, accessibility, content.
2. Log issues by severity: **Blocker** (must be fixed before handoff), **Should fix**, **Nice to have**.
3. Agent: check whatever can be checked automatically (default names, values not bound to tokens, frames without Auto Layout, contrast, text overflow) with the read-only audit/stress tools; check the rest via screenshots. State clearly which warnings are false positives.
4. **Gate:** present the QA report; move on to handoff only after the Blocker items are fixed.

### Stage 8 — Handoff

Read `references/handoff-qa.md` sections 4–6.

1. Mark Ready for dev per Section, write annotations for behavior that isn't visible (logic, edge cases, animation, accessibility).
2. Map tokens to code (Swift/Kotlin/CSS) using the table in `handoff-qa.md`. If Code Connect is available, connect components to the real code.
3. Write the library version changelog; publish the library with a description of the changes.

## Output by mode

**Agent:** real changes in the Figma file + a short report: what was created/edited (with node IDs or links), which decisions were locked, what remains open. Don't re-describe what the user can open and see for themselves.

**Designer:** an instruction document containing: goal → steps (numbered, naming the exact menu/shortcut/panel) → value tables (tokens, naming) → self-check checklist. Each step is specific enough to follow without guessing.

## Self-check before reporting done

- No default-named layers remain in the scope worked on.
- No hand-typed colors/font sizes/spacing outside the primitive level (Stage 4 directions: only brand/accent hex, listed in the direction's palette).
- Content frames all use Auto Layout; test resizing doesn't break them.
- All states and dark mode are present (if the project has modes).
- Body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1, large text and UI elements ≥ 3:1.
- Agent: screenshotted and reviewed the final result; deleted nothing out of scope.
- Every screen went through Pass 1 → 3 (Sketch: 1 → 2) and met the Definition of Done before the next screen started.
- Passed the human approval gates corresponding to the stages that were run.

## Common pitfalls

- **Jumping straight to pixels** without a brief and tokens → everything must be redone when the direction changes.
- **Variant explosion** (Size × State × Icon × Theme = hundreds) → use boolean/instance-swap properties and variable modes instead of variants.
- **Dark mode by duplicating screens** → use modes on the Semantic collection.
- **Groups instead of Frames** → Groups have no Auto Layout, padding, or clipping; use Groups only for illustrations.
- **"Creative" = adding effects** → creativity lies in how content is organized and the emotion it evokes; effects only serve the idea.
- **Agent writes a big chunk before checking** (a whole finished screen, or all 3 screens, in one write) → errors pile on errors and fixing costs many times more. Lock the layout with placeholders first, then fill.
- **Checking too densely** (a screenshot after every small block) → slow and token-heavy, and most shots find nothing. Check numbers every write with `get_node`, look once per pass.
- **Polishing before the gate** → building out all 3 directions in detail before the user has chosen. In Stage 4, build each direction in Sketch mode (Pass 1–2), just enough to compare, then stop.
- **Copying a famous app verbatim** → references must state which principle is being taken, not the surface.
