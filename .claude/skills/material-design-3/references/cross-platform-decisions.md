# Cross-platform decision matrix (iOS ↔ Android)

Use this when one product ships on iOS and Android and you must pick the right native pattern on each side, or decide between native, shared
and custom components. For a component-by-component iOS ↔ Android name map see
`../../design-system-audit/references/component-system.md`. Verbatim rules: iOS → `../../apple-hig/references/<page>.md`,
Android → the `components__*.md` pages in this folder.

## 1. Navigation by number of destinations and width

| Situation | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| 3–5 destinations, phone | Tab bar | Navigation bar |
| Many destinations, tablet | Sidebar / adaptable tab bar | Navigation rail or drawer |
| List-detail | Navigation stack → split view | Single pane → list-detail canonical layout |
| Search is a main area | Search tab / search field | Search destination / search bar / search view |
| Per-screen actions | Toolbar / navigation bar actions | Top app bar / toolbar / FAB, depending on priority |

iOS pages: `tab-bars.md`, `sidebars.md`, `split-views.md`, `search-fields.md`, `toolbars.md`. Android pages: `components__navigation-bar.md`,
`components__navigation-rail.md`, `components__navigation-drawer.md`, `foundations__layout__canonical-examples.md`, `components__search.md`,
`components__app-bars.md`, `components__toolbars.md`, `components__floating-action-button.md`.

## 2. Presentation by complexity

| Content | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| Short choice tied to a source | Menu / popover / action sheet | Menu / bottom sheet |
| Blocking decision, few actions | Alert | Basic dialog |
| Short secondary task | Sheet | Modal bottom sheet / dialog |
| Long / complex task | Full-screen cover / navigation push | Full-screen dialog / destination |
| Secondary pane on wide screens | Inspector / split view / sidebar | Side sheet / supporting pane |

## 3. Feedback

| Situation | Preferred approach |
|---|---|
| Tap received | Press / ripple / highlight + state change |
| Quick save | Update directly; inline confirmation is optional |
| Background save | Progress inside the control, or a non-blocking status |
| Delete with undo | Android: snackbar. iOS: a suitable inline element/banner, or direct restore |
| Form error | Inline error + focus / announcement |
| Whole-page error | Error state + retry |
| Decision needed | Alert / dialog |

## 4. When to use native, shared or custom components

**Native component** when:
- There is a strong convention: date picker, share, permission, authentication, menu, navigation.
- Accessibility and behaviour are complex.
- Users expect system integration.

**Shared visual component** when:
- The brand needs consistency and the behaviour is simple.
- Tokens can map onto native semantics.
- A team exists to maintain accessibility on both platforms.

**Custom component** only when:
- No native component meets the task.
- The measurable UX benefit outweighs the learning and maintenance cost.
- It has full states, keyboard, screen reader, large text, RTL, reduced motion, and tests.

## 5. Final decision rule

When iOS HIG, Material and the brand conflict, decide in this order:
1. Protect safety, privacy and accessibility first.
2. Keep the platform's mental model and conventions for **behaviour**.
3. Keep task efficiency and recoverability.
4. Express the brand in the remaining visuals / content / motion.
5. Prototype and test if the trade-off is still unclear.
